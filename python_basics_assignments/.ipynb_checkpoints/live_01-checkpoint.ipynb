    "# WHY\n",
    "1. Python is uppercase and hence we have encountered error since Print has capital P which makes it not recognised by the interpreter giving us an error.\n",
    "Which could have been avoided by using 'print'.\n",
    "2. print is a function which needs it parameters to be passed using '()'.\n",
    "3. For a multi line string we need to use triple \" without which we encounter error as using single \" does not enable interpreter to read string in multilines.\n",
    "4. Sunny is written in single \" which ends the prev strting \" we instead could have used \\\" i.e. an escape sequence or could have put our string in triple \".\n",
    "5,6,7,8. Variable names have certain rules that shoud not be violeted for the language to function properrly not following them may give us error.\n",
    "    The rules are:\n",
    "    1. Variable names should start with alphabets\n",
    "    2. Variable names should not contain any special characters like ^ % $ ! @ # ^ & * ( )\n",
    "    3. Variable names can contain numbers but you can't start with numbers\n",
    "9,10,11. String and integers are different data types. '+' operator cannot work on them.\n",
    "12. Ten was not initialised\n",
    "13. print is assigned as a string variable and hence is no more treated as a function. It needs to be deleted to restore as function.\n",
    "14. print is assigned as a int variable and hence is no more treated as a function. It needs to be deleted to restore as function.\n",
    "15. year_of_birth is a string hence '-' operator gives error when used between an int and string\n",
    "16. A cannot be typecasted to string using this syntax. The correct syntax is int(A).\n",
    "17. A is assigned to typecasted int value returned by input(), which returns value as a string and 10.2 in string cannot be directly converted to int. \n",
    "    We can take a turnaround for this conversion by : int(float(input(\"...\")))\n",
    "18. A is taken as a string and 50.22 in string cannot be directly converted to int. \n",
    "    We can take a turnaround for this conversion by : int(float(A))\n",
    "19. A is assigned an empty string and hence cannot be converted into an integer.\n",
